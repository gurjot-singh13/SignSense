SIGN SENSE
About This Project
SignSense uses TensorFlow.js, MediaPipe, and OpenCV to detect and recognize American Sign Language (ASL) gestures in real-time through your webcam.

This demo can recognize 7 common ASL signs: hello, sorry, thanks, I love you, yes, no, and help. The detection model works best with good lighting and a clear background.

For better detection accuracy, you can train a custom model with your own signs and gestures. The system is designed to be extendable for additional sign recognition capabilities.
